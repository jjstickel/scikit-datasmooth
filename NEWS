Datasmooth Release Notes

datasmooth 0.61 2011-04-13

------------------------

The primary purpose of this release is the addition of html
documentation (generated by pydoc) and examples.  Other changes of
note include:

- improved handling of the case when cvxopt is not available so that
  regularsmooth.py and regularsmooth_no_constr.py could be merged into
  one file

- the mapping of smooth points to scattered data was changed from
  nearest-neighbor to linear interpolation
